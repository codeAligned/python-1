'''Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:

Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly
in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” Every time
the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game
is over. Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout teh game and tell the user at the end.

Say the number generated by the computer is 1038. An example interaction could look like this:

  Welcome to the Cows and Bulls Game! 
  Enter a number: 
  >>> 1234
  2 cows, 0 bulls
  >>> 1256
  1 cow, 1 bull
  ...

Until the user guesses the number.'''




from random import randint

number = randint(1000, 9999)
# print(number)


def cows_and_bulls():
    cows = 0
    bulls = 0

    print('Guess the number')

    while True:
        user_number = input('Input 4 digit number: ')

        if len(user_number) >= 4:
            for index, value in enumerate(user_number):
                if str(number)[index] == value:
                    cows += 1
                else:
                    if value in str(number):
                        bulls += 1

            print("{}cows, {}bulls".format(cows, bulls))

            if cows == 4:
                print("You win!!!")
                break
        else:
            print('Wrong input!!!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cows_and_bulls()
