Your mission is to convert the name of a function (a string) from CamelCase ("MyFunctionName") into the Python format ("my_function_name")
where all chars are in lowercase and all words are concatenated with an intervening underscore symbol "_".

Input: A function name as a CamelCase string.

Output: The same string, but in under_score.
