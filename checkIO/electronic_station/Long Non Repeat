"""
A very similar to the first is the second mission of the series with only one distinction is that you should 
look in a completely different way. You need to find the first longest substring with all unique letters. For example,
in substring "abca" we have two substrings with unique letters "abc" and "bca", but we should take the first one, so the answer is "abc".

Input: String.

Output: String.
