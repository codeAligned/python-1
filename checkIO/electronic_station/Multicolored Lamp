'''
  Your task is to create the class Lamp() and method light() which will make the lamp glow with one of the four colors in the sequence
  - (‘Green’, ‘Red’, ‘Blue’, ‘Yellow’). When the light() method is used for the first time, the color should be 'Green', the second
  time - 'Red' and so on. If the current color is 'Yellow', the next color should be 'Green' and so on
