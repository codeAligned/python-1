# You are given a time in 24-hour format and you should calculate a lesser angle between the hour and minute hands in degrees.

#  where HH is hours and MM is minutes. Hours and minutes are given in two digits format, so "1" will be writen as "01". The result
#  should be given in degrees with precision Â±0.1.
