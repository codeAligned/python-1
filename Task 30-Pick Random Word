In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.
Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary
of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

        word = file.readlines()

        return random.choice(word).strip()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(random_word())
