'''
Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some different code, 
use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code,
just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

    Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
