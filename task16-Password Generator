'''Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase
letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your code in a main method.

Extra:

    Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

    ascii = ''.join([chr(i) for i in range(33, 130)])

    if password_strong >= 4:
        password = ''.join(random.sample(ascii, password_strong))
        print('Your password is: ', password)
    else:
